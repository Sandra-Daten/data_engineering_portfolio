### Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio!  
This repository contains a collection of hands-on tasks and mini-projects built using tools and technologies like Docker, Docker Compose, Java Spring Boot, Flask, Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and more.

Each project is organized into folders with clearly structured code, Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml` configurations, and example usage scripts (`run.sh`, etc.).

### Covered Topics

- Containerizing single-page applications with Docker  
- Multi-container application setups  
- Inter-service communication via Docker networks and shared volumes  
- Java microservices with Spring Boot  
- Simple frontends with Nginx and Angular  
- Backend logic using Flask, Node.js, and Java

I appreciate you being here! While you're digging through this portfolio, I'm already diving into the next chapters â€” like HDFS, Spark, and Kafka.  
Looking forward to hearing from you soon!  

**Hakuna matata!**
